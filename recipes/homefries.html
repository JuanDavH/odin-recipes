    <p>Learn how to make home fries crispy like the ones at your local diner!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large russet potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch onion powder</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange potatoes evenly on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high until just tender, 
            about 4 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Cut potatoes into bite-sized chunks.</li>
        <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until butter 
            melts and starts to turn brown. Swirl the pan and add potatoes; shake the pan 
            to arrange in an even layer. Season with paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, 
            onion powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Continue to toss potatoes and cook until reddish-brown, crusty, and crispy on 
            the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. If potatoes are cooking too quickly, reduce the 
            heat to medium. Garnish with chives.</li>
    </ol>
